  about:
    "I am a Frontend Engineer, but beyond the digital realm, I find joy in creating art as well. My artistic creations take shape during explorations of virtual worlds, where I use my technical prowess to bring my visions to life. Afterwards, I further refine my works with a variety of graphic tools, pushing the limits of my creativity and skillset. Through my photography, I seek to capture moments of beauty and emotion, both in the virtual and physical worlds, and share them with others.",
